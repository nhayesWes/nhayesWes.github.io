Contains all of the files for the alpha version of a landing page called "Boomtree", created by Nigel Hayes from Wesleyan University.

The current version of the Boomtree website uses a fairly minimalist design inspired by Spotify and more.

This site was designed and published as part of the COMP 333 Software Engineering class at Wesleyan University. The described platform is not publicly available but rather is created as a training exercise.
